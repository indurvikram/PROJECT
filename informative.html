        <h1>EDUREKA</h1>
        <p>Edureka is an online education and e-learning platform, privately owned and operated by Brain4ce Education
            Pvt. Ltd. headquartered in Bangalore. It provides courses in trending technologies like Big data, Cloud
            computing, blockchain and artificial intelligence. The platform offers live interactive sessions, masters
            programs and post graduate programs.</p>
        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
        <p>Edureka was founded in 2011 by Lovleen Bhatia and Kapil Tyagi. In 2005, the duo had together founded DByDx
            Software, a mobile app development company. In 2011 they sold DByDx Software to Kellton Tech for $3
            million. Proceeds from this sale helped them fund Edureka with an initial self-investment of Rs. 1.5
            crores. Vineet Chaturvedi joined as the third co-founder later<br>

            In June 2018, Edureka raised $2 million in the first round of funding from Venture firm Leo Capital
            India. With this investment, Rajul Garg, founder & managing partner of Leo Capital, joined the board of
            Edureka<br>

            In April 2019, NIT Warangal announced a Post Graduate Program in Artificial Intelligence and Machine
            Learning in partnership with Edureka.<br>

            In June 2019, NIT Rourkela also partnered with Edureka to provide a Post Graduate Program in Big data
            engineering.<br>

            In August 2019, IMT Ghaziabad partnered with Edureka to offer live online courses in business management
            domain for executive certification courses.<br>

            In 2019, IIT Kanpur started a 9-month program for certification in cloud computing in collaboration with
            Edureka.</p>
